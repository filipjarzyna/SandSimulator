# Sand Simulator
## About
This project is an interactive sand simulator built with JavaScript. It allows users to spawn falling sand particles, where each grain falls down and piles up on others. Users can customize the color of the sand using a color slider below the canvas, creating an engaging and visual sandbox experience directly in the browser.
